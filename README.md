# AcousticPropagation
A Matlab code to model the attenuation coefficent and speed of sound in a gase mixture.
Based on the work of Richard Lueptow and Andi Petculescu(DOI: 10.1121/1.1828547, 10.1121/1.1352087).
It was used in Gillier et al (2024) *Geographical, seasonal and diurnal variations of acoustic attenuation and sound speed in the near-surface Martian atmosphere*, JGR-Planet to model sound attenuationand speed at the surface of Mars.

The FP acousticModel directory contains the functions implementing this first principle acoustic model, the Auxiliary directory some auxiliary functions and teh Data directory molecular properties of a few species.
The Tutorial.m file shows how to use the model with a simple example.
