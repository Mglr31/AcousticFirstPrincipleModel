# AcousticPropagation
A Matlab code to model the attenuation coefficent and speed of sound in a gase mixture.
Based on the work of Richard Lueptow and Andi Petculescu(DOI: 10.1121/1.1828547, 10.1121/1.1352087).
It was used in Gillier et al (2024) //Geographical, seasonal and diurnal variations of acoustic attenuation and sound speed in the near-surface Martian atmosphere//, JGR-Planet to model sound attenuationand speed at the surface of Mars.
